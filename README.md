## 🚀 Project Overview

This advanced **Multisensor Fusion & Real-Time 3D Object Tracking** pipeline leverages the KITTI dataset's camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and labels to create a seamless, interactive visualization of dynamic traffic scenes.

- **Robust sensor fusion** combining LiDAR depth and RGB camera images.
- **Persistent object tracking** using a custom Kalman Filter-based multi-object tracker.
- **Dynamic 3D bounding boxes** projected onto 2D images, color-coded per tracked ID.
- **Natural language scene summaries** generated live via OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo — describing traffic behavior frame-by-frame.
- **Rich visual outputs** including GIF animations of tracking and a detailed trajectory summary image.
- Designed for **real-time performance** with downsampling and efficient data handling.

This project is a showcase of state-of-the-art robotics perception, sensor fusion, and AI-powered explanation — a perfect portfolio piece for roles in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and intelligent systems.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Python 3.13 and dependencies**

   Recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the KITTI Dataset**

   * Download the required sequences from the official [KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/).
   * Organize the dataset in the folder structure as described above.
   * Place calibration files in the `calib/` folder and labels in `label_2/`.

4. **Set your OpenAI API Key as environment variable**

   * On Windows PowerShell:

     ```powershell
     [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("my_api_key", "your_actual_api_key_here", "User")
     ```

   * On Unix/macOS terminal:

     ```bash
     export my_api_key="your_actual_api_key_here"
     ```

## 🚀 How to Run

Simply execute the main animation script:

```bash
python animate_fusion.py
```

* Use the **Pause/Play** button to control the animation.
* After closing the window, a GIF animation (`fusion_tracking.gif`) and a trajectory summary image (`trajectory_summary.png`) will be saved automatically.
* Watch live 3D bounding boxes, tracked IDs, and dynamic GPT-generated scene summaries!

## 🧠 Technical Details

* **Sensor Fusion Pipeline:**
  Using KITTI's Velodyne-to-camera calibration matrices, the 3D LiDAR points are projected onto the 2D camera plane. Points are colored by intensity for intuitive depth perception.

* **Tracking:**
  A custom `MultiObjectTracker` class (Kalman filter based) maintains object identities and trajectories, handling frame-to-frame association robustly.

* **3D Bounding Boxes:**
  Object dimensions, locations, and yaw rotations from KITTI labels are used to compute accurate 3D box corners, projected into the image frame.

* **Scene Summarization:**
  The OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model receives current tracked objects and outputs a concise human-readable summary of traffic flow and object states, updated every frame.

* **Visualization:**
  Built with matplotlib’s `FuncAnimation` and interactive widgets for user-friendly control.
